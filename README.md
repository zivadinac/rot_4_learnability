# rot_4_learnability
Repository for IST rotation 4 project.

Investigating "learnability" (motivated by [Clustering of Neural Activity: A Design Principle for Population Codes](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~gtkacik/Frontiers_Clusters.pdf)) of cluster code in retinal ganglion cells.
Using method from [Error-Robust Modes of the Retinal Population Code](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~gtkacik/PLOSCompBio_RobustCode.pdf) included as a TreeHMM-local submodule.
